The ParseSocket is a subclass of HTTPSecureSocket for use with Real Studio.
You may use this class under the terms of the License.txt file (MIT license). 

If you don't know what Parse.com does, then you'd better have a look!
http://www.parse.com

This class uses the REST api and needs two things from your parse.com account.
App id and rest api key. Those are needed to make api calls to parse.com.

The code is fully documented inside the class. it's open source and anyone may modify, copy or use it even commercially!
